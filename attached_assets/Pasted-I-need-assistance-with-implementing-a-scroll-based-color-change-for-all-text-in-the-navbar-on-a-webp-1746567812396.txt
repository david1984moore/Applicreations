I need assistance with implementing a scroll-based color change for all text in the navbar on a webpage. Currently, the navbar text (including the logo text "ppl creations" and the navigation links "Home," "What We Do," "Contact") remains white when scrolling to lighter sections of the page, such as the "Our Services" section with a white background. I want all navbar text to automatically change to a dark color (e.g., black, #000000) when the user scrolls to a lighter part of the page, and revert to white when over the gradient header background at the top of the page.

Here are the details and steps to resolve the issue:

Webpage Context:
The webpage has a header with a gradient background transitioning from deep purple (approximately #6B48FF) on the left to a lighter cyan-blue (approximately #00DDEB) on the right.
The navbar contains:
A logo in the top-left corner that reads "ppl creations," rendered as an SVG with <path> elements using classes like cls-4 for white fill.
Navigation links ("Home," "What We Do," "Contact") in the top-right corner, likely rendered as <a> elements.
The page has sections below the header with a white background, such as the "Our Services" section containing "Web Development" and "App Development" subsections.
A previous attempt to implement scroll-based color changes for the logo text failed, and the navbar text remains white regardless of scroll position.
Issue with the Navbar Text:
All text in the navbar (logo text "ppl creations" and navigation links) stays white when scrolling to the white-background "Our Services" section, causing low contrast and poor readability.
The desired behavior is for all navbar text to:
Be white when the header is over the gradient background at the top of the page.
Change to a dark color (e.g., black, #000000) when scrolling to the white-background sections like "Our Services."
Tasks for Replit Agent:
Step 1: Inspect the Navbar Structure
Locate the HTML elements for the navbar, which include:
The logo text "ppl creations" (an SVG with <path> elements, likely using classes like cls-4 for white fill).
The navigation links "Home," "What We Do," and "Contact" (likely <a> elements within a <nav> or <div>). Check the current CSS classes and styles applied to these elements to understand how their color is set (e.g., fill for the SVG paths, color for the navigation links).
Step 2: Identify or Implement a Scroll Detection Mechanism
Check if thereâ€™s an existing JavaScript mechanism for detecting scroll position and changing element styles (e.g., a scroll event listener). If one exists, it may be incomplete or not targeting the navbar text correctly. If no mechanism exists, implement one using JavaScript:
Add a scroll event listener to the window object.
Use window.scrollY to determine the scroll position.
Identify the position of the "Our Services" section (e.g., using getBoundingClientRect() or offsetTop) to detect when the header overlaps with the white background.
Step 3: Update Navbar Text Colors Based on Scroll Position
Modify the JavaScript to dynamically change the color of all navbar text based on scroll position:
For the logo text (SVG <path> elements):
When the scroll position is at the top (over the gradient background), ensure the <path> elements use a class like cls-4 (white fill) or set fill: #FFFFFF;.
When the scroll position reaches the white-background section (e.g., "Our Services"), switch the <path> elements to a dark class (e.g., cls-1 if it defines a dark fill) or set fill: #000000;.
For the navigation links:
When at the top, ensure the links have color: #FFFFFF;.
When over the white background, set color: #000000;.
This can be achieved by toggling classes (e.g., adding/removing light and dark classes) or directly setting the fill and color styles via JavaScript.
Step 4: Ensure Smooth Transitions
Add a CSS transition to make the color change smooth, if not already present. For example:
For the SVG paths: transition: fill 0.3s ease;
For the navigation links: transition: color 0.3s ease;
Step 5: Test the Behavior
Scroll through the page to verify that:
All navbar text (logo and navigation links) is white when over the gradient header at the top.
All navbar text changes to black when scrolling to the white-background "Our Services" section.
The transition is smooth and the text remains readable at all times.
Step 6: Provide Updated Code
Share the updated JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (if needed) for the navbar section to implement the scroll-based color change for all navbar text.
Additional Notes:
Use a dark color like black (#000000) for the navbar text when over the white background to ensure sufficient contrast.
Do not modify the gradient background, section layouts, or other elements unless necessary for the navbar text color change.
Maintain the professional and modern aesthetic of the webpage, ensuring the color transitions are smooth and visually appealing.
Please provide the updated code for the navbar section, including the JavaScript for scroll detection, any CSS class changes, and modifications to the SVG <path> elements and navigation links, to ensure all navbar text changes to black over lighter backgrounds and reverts to white over the gradient header. Confirm that the behavior works as expected.
