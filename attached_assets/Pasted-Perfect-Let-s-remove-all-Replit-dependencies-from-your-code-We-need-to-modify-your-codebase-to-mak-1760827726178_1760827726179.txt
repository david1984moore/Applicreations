Perfect! Let's remove all Replit dependencies from your code. We need to modify your codebase to make it platform-agnostic.

Remove Replit Dependencies
Step 1: Find All Replit References in Your Code
Let's search your codebase for Replit-specific code. In your terminal (in your project directory):
bash# Search for all Replit references
grep -r "REPLIT" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" server/ client/ src/
Or if you prefer, search in your code editor for:

REPLIT_DOMAINS
REPLIT_CLIENT_ID
REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT
openid-client (the library causing the current error)
replitDeployment


Step 2: Locate the Problem Files
Based on your error logs, the issues are in:

src/dist/index.js:275 - REPLIT_DOMAINS check
src/node_modules/openid-client/build/index.js:89 - OpenID client setup

The actual source code (not the built dist/ files) will be in your server/ or src/ directory.
ðŸ“‹ Can you check:

Do you have a server/ folder or src/ folder with your backend code?
What's the file structure? (run ls -la in your project root)


Step 3: Common Files to Modify
Typically, Replit Auth setup would be in one of these files:

server/index.ts or server/index.js (main server file)
server/auth.ts or server/routes/auth.ts (authentication setup)
server/config.ts (configuration)


Step 4: What We Need to Change
We'll need to:
A. Remove REPLIT_DOMAINS check
Find code that looks like:
typescriptif (!process.env.REPLIT_DOMAINS) {
  throw new Error("Environment variable REPLIT_DOMAINS not provided");
}
Replace with:
typescript// Remove this check entirely, or make it optional
const domains = process.env.ALLOWED_DOMAINS || 'localhost';
B. Remove/Make Optional OpenID Client Setup
Find code that looks like:
typescriptimport { Issuer } from 'openid-client';

// Some setup for Replit Auth
const replitIssuer = await Issuer.discover('https://replit.com/.well-known/openid-configuration');
const client = new replitIssuer.Client({
  client_id: process.env.REPLIT_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: process.env.REPLIT_CLIENT_SECRET,
  // ...
});
Replace with:
typescript// Make it conditional - only set up if Replit variables exist
if (process.env.REPLIT_CLIENT_ID && process.env.REPLIT_CLIENT_SECRET) {
  // Keep Replit Auth setup for backward compatibility if needed
} else {
  console.log('Replit Auth not configured - skipping');
}
```

Or better yet, **remove it entirely** if you don't need Replit Auth.

## Step 5: I Need to See Your Code

To help you make these specific changes, I need to see:

1. **Your main server file** - Can you share the contents of:
   - `server/index.ts` or `server/index.js`
   - Or whatever your main backend entry point is

2. **Your auth setup file** - If you have a separate auth file:
   - `server/auth.ts`
   - `server/routes/auth.ts`
   - Or wherever Passport is configured

## Quick Way to Share Files

You can either:

**Option A:** Upload the files directly (drag and drop into chat)

**Option B:** Copy and paste the contents, like:
```
--- server/index.ts ---
[paste your code here]
Option C: Use the view tool if you have your project locally. Tell me the path to your server files and I can read them.
