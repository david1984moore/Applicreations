Tasks for Replit Agent:
Step 1: Identify the Scroll-Based Color Change Mechanism
Inspect the existing code for the navigation links ("Home," "What We Do," "Contact") to understand how their color changes when scrolling. Look for JavaScript or CSS that adjusts the text color based on scroll position or the background color of the section beneath the header. This might involve a scroll event listener that toggles classes or directly changes the fill color of elements.
Step 2: Apply the Same Mechanism to the Logo Text
Ensure the logo text "ppl creations" (rendered as SVG <path> elements) follows the same scroll-based color change mechanism. The logo text is currently using the cls-4 class for a white fill. Modify the code so that:
When the header is over the gradient background (at the top of the page), the logo text uses cls-4 (white fill).
When scrolling to a section with a white background (e.g., "Web Development" or "App Development"), the logo text switches to a dark color, such as black or dark gray (e.g., a class like cls-1 if it defines a dark fill, or directly set fill: #333333;).
This can be achieved by dynamically toggling the class on the SVG <path> elements or by directly updating their fill style based on the scroll position.
Step 3: Update the SVG Paths
If the navigation links use a class-toggling mechanism, apply the same class changes to the SVG <path> elements of the logo text. For example, if the navigation links toggle between cls-4 (white) and cls-1 (dark) based on scroll position, ensure the logo’s <path> elements also toggle between these classes. If the mechanism directly updates the fill style, modify the JavaScript to include the logo’s SVG paths in the color change logic.
Step 4: Test the Color Change Behavior
Scroll through the page to verify that:
The logo text is white when over the gradient header background at the top.
The logo text changes to a dark color (e.g., black or dark gray) when scrolling to the white-background sections like "Web Development" and "App Development".
The color change is smooth and consistent with the navigation links’ behavior.
Step 5: Provide Updated Code
Share the updated code for the logo section, including any changes to the SVG <path> elements, CSS classes, or JavaScript logic that enable the scroll-based color change for the logo text.
Additional Notes:
Do not modify the gradient background, navigation links, or other elements of the page unless necessary for the logo color change.
Ensure the dark color chosen for the logo text provides sufficient contrast against the white background (e.g., black #000000 or dark gray #333333).
Maintain the professional and modern aesthetic of the webpage, ensuring the color transitions are smooth and visually appealing.
