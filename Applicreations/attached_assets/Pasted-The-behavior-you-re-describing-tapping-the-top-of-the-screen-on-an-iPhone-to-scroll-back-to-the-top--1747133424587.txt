The behavior you’re describing—tapping the top of the screen on an iPhone to scroll back to the top of the page—is a native iOS feature in Safari and many web apps. It’s not something you explicitly code into your site; rather, it’s a default behavior of the iOS system that works in certain contexts, particularly when the status bar (the area at the top of the screen with the time, battery, etc.) is tapped. However, this functionality can sometimes fail to work on web apps if certain conditions aren’t met, or it may not be supported in all environments (like the Google app’s WebView, as you mentioned in your previous query). Let’s break this down and ensure it works for your site on your iPhone 13.

Why This Functionality Works (or Doesn’t)
The “tap to scroll to top” feature is built into iOS’s WebKit engine (used by Safari and many iOS WebViews). When you tap the status bar area, iOS interprets this as a request to scroll the primary scrollable element (usually the window or document.body) to the top. However, there are a few reasons this might not work on your site:
1.  Non-Standard Scroll Containers:
	•  If your page uses a custom scrollable container (e.g., a div with overflow: auto or overflow: scroll) instead of the main window or body for scrolling, iOS won’t know which element to scroll. The tap-to-top feature only works on the main document scroll.
2.  Fixed or Sticky Elements Blocking the Status Bar:
	•  If you have a fixed or sticky header (like your .navbar from the previous query) that overlaps the status bar area, it might intercept the tap event, preventing iOS from detecting the status bar tap.
3.  Viewport Misconfiguration:
	•  If your viewport meta tag or CSS doesn’t properly account for the safe area (as we discussed in your previous query), the status bar tap area might not register correctly.
4.  WebView Limitations:
	•  If you’re testing this in the Google app’s WebView (as in your previous issue), this feature might not be supported. The Google app’s WebView doesn’t always replicate all of Safari’s native behaviors, including tap-to-top.
5.  JavaScript Event Listeners:
	•  If you’ve added a tap or click event listener to the top of the page (or the body), it might prevent the default iOS behavior by stopping event propagation.

How to Ensure This Functionality Works on Your Site
To make sure the tap-to-top feature works on your site in Safari (and potentially other WebViews), you need to ensure your site adheres to iOS’s expected behavior for scrolling. Here’s how to implement and verify this:
Step 1: Use the Main Document for Scrolling
Ensure that the primary scrolling on your page happens on the window or document.body, not a nested scrollable container. If your content is inside a div with overflow: scroll, the tap-to-top feature won’t work because iOS only scrolls the main document.
Check your HTML/CSS structure. It should look something like this: 
HTML:
<body>
  <div class="navbar">...</div>
  <main>
    <!-- Your content here -->
    <section>...</section>
    <section>...</section>
    <!-- Long content that causes the body to scroll -->
  </main>
</body>

CSS
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 100%;
  overflow-x: hidden; /* Prevent horizontal scrolling */
}

body {
  overflow-y: auto; /* Ensure the body is the scrollable element */
}

main {
  padding: 20px;
  /* Don’t use overflow: scroll here */
}

/* If you have a fixed navbar */
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 60px;
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top); /* From your previous fix */
}

•  Avoid using overflow: scroll on a container like main or a div unless absolutely necessary. If you must have a scrollable container, the tap-to-top feature won’t apply to it, and you’ll need a custom solution (see below).
Step 2: Don’t Block the Status Bar Tap Area
Ensure that your fixed or sticky elements (like the .navbar) don’t interfere with the status bar tap. The status bar area should be tappable, and no elements should overlap it in a way that intercepts the tap event.
From your previous query, your .navbar is already using env(safe-area-inset-top) to avoid overlapping the status bar, which is good: 
CSS
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
}

Double-check that no other elements (or event listeners) are covering the top of the page. For example, avoid something like this:
CSS

.some-element {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  height: 100px; /* This might overlap the status bar and block the tap */
}

Step 3: Avoid Interfering Event Listeners
If you have JavaScript event listeners on the body or top elements, ensure they don’t stop the default behavior of the status bar tap. For example, if you have a click listener on the body:
JavaScript 

document.body.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Do something
  event.preventDefault(); // This will block the tap-to-top feature
});

To fix this, allow the event to propagate unless you specifically need to block it:
JavaScript 

document.body.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Only preventDefault if necessary
  if (event.target.closest('.some-specific-element')) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});

Best Practices for Implementation
1.  Rely on Native Behavior When Possible:
	•  The iOS tap-to-top feature is the best user experience for Safari users because it’s intuitive and doesn’t require extra UI elements. Ensure your site supports it by using the main document for scrolling and avoiding interference. 

The tap-to-top feature should work automatically in Safari on your iPhone 13 if you follow these steps:
•  Use the main body for scrolling, not a custom container.
•  Ensure your .navbar doesn’t block the status bar tap area.
•  Avoid JavaScript event listeners that interfere with the default behavior.
