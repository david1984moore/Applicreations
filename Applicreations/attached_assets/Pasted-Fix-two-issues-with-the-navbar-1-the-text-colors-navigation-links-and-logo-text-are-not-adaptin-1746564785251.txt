Fix two issues with the navbar: (1) the text colors (navigation links and logo text) are not adapting to the background of the section I’m scrolling over, and (2) the navbar elements are not positioned at the very top of the page.

For issue 1: In the index.html file, locate the <script> tag at the bottom of the <body> section that handles the dynamic navbar background change. Update the script to correctly change the nav ul li a color and the logo text fill (.cls-4, .cls-9, .cls-10, .cls-11, .cls-15 in the navbar SVG) based on the section in view. The script should:
- Use window.scrollY to get the scroll position.
- Target the sections: .hero, #services, and #contact.
- Calculate the offsetTop of each section, adjusting for the fixed navbar height (70px) by subtracting 70 from each section’s offsetTop.
- Update the nav background, link colors, and logo text fill as follows:
  - For .hero (background: linear-gradient(90deg, #6b48ff, #00ddeb)): set link color to "white", logo text fill to "white", and link hover color to "#f0f0f0".
  - For #services (background: #f5f5f5): set link color to "#1f2937" (dark gray), logo text fill to "#1f2937", and link hover color to "#e0e0e0".
  - For #contact (background: #1f2937): set link color to "white", logo text fill to "white", and link hover color to "#f0f0f0".
- Ensure the script runs on scroll and on page load. Add console.log statements to debug the scroll position and section offsets to verify the logic.

For issue 2: In the style.css file, ensure the nav element is positioned at the very top of the page by confirming it has "position: fixed;", "top: 0;", "width: 100%;", and "z-index: 1000;". Remove any conflicting styles (e.g., margin-top, padding-top, or top values other than 0) on the nav element. Set "margin: 0;" and "padding: 0;" on the html and body elements to eliminate any gaps at the top of the page. If the nav element is inside a parent element (e.g., a header), ensure the parent has "margin: 0;" and "padding: 0;" to avoid pushing the navbar down.

Verify that the navbar stays fixed at the very top of the page, its background changes to match the section in view, and the navigation links and logo text are always visible with the correct colors in all sections.
